# To-Do

# In this application a user can add to-do list items to their to-do list and display them in the browser using ORM, MySQL database, express, and express-handlebars.

# When a user adds a to-do list item, the input information is retrieved by todo.js and routed via todo_controllers.js.

# Todo_controllers.js then uses the models and orm to send and receive the data to/from the database.

# Once received, todo_controllers.js sends the information to the handlebars view, through which the information is displayed in the browser.
